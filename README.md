# finalproject-tunnelrush.github.io
I spent over 2 weeks trying to find a legit tunnel rush on github and I gave up, so I made my own legit one (which took a lot of work.) I was up until 2-3am everyday for two weeks until about tonight when I completely finished it! Idk if you can deploy it or not but i'm pretty sure vercel works. Anyway Bye!
